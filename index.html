      <h3 class="border-top">About Sleppy</h3>
        <p>As a Colorado native, I grew up in the city of Denver. I later attended Centaurus High School where I first began my journey into software development. After high school, I graduated from Front Range Community College where I truly decided to dive into my future by joining the Thinkful family.</p>

         <p>Being a Coloradoan, I have a variety of hobbies such as:</p>

         <ul>
           <li>Snowboarding</li>
           <li>Golfing</li>
           <li>Hiking</li>

        <p>When winter rolls around snowboarding is one of my passionate hobbies. The backcountry is breathtaking and one of the greatest feelings is the adrenaline rush from speeding down the slopes.</p>

        <p>During spring and summer golfing and hiking take over my winter hobby and become predominate. Sunday's have become time for me to engage with friends by doing weekly golf days, and sporadic hikes with my dogs are the best escape from reality. 

        <article>If you ever want to go golf, hike, or even snowboard you know where to reach me!</article>
